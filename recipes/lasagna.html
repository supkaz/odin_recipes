    <h2>HOW TO DO IT</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>First, make the béchamel sauce. Put the milk, onion, 
        bay leaves and cloves into a large saucepan and bring very gently just up to the boil. 
       <br> Turn off the heat and set aside for 1 hr to infuse.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic and pancetta in another large saucepan.
           <br>  Gently cook together until the veg is soft but not coloured.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Tip in the beef and pork mince, the milk and chopped tomatoes. 
        Using a wooden spoon, stir together and break up and mash the lumps of mince against the sides 
        <br>of the pan. When the mince is mostly broken down, stir in all the herbs, 
        <br>the stock cubes and the red wine, and bring to a simmer. 
        <br>Cover and cook for 1 hr, stirring occasionally to stop the bottom catching.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Uncover and gently simmer for another 30 mins-1 hr until the meat is tender and saucy. <br>Taste and season.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>To finish the béchamel sauce, strain the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs. <br> Melt the butter in the same pan then, using a wooden spoon, mix in the flour and cook for 2 mins.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Stir in the strained milk, a little at a time – the mix will thicken at first to a doughy paste, <br> but keep going, adding milk gradually to avoid lumps. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly (if you have lumps, give it a quick whisk). Gently bubble for a few minutes until thickened. Season with salt, pepper and a good grating of nutmeg.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Spread a spoonful of the meat sauce over the base of a roughly 3.5-litre baking dish. <br> Cover with a single layer of dried pasta sheets, snapping them to fit if needed, then top with a quarter of the béchamel. Spoon over a third of the meat sauce and scatter over a little of the parmesan.</p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>Repeat the layers – pasta, béchamel, meat and parmesan – two more times to use all the meat sauce. <br> Add a final layer of pasta, the last of the béchamel and remaining parmesan. Sit the dish on a baking tray to catch spills and bake for 1 hr until bubbling, browned and crisp on top.</p>
    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>THERE IS NO STEP 9, JUST EAT YOUR LASAGNE </p>
