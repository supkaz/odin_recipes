      <h1>The Unofficial Guide to Scrambled Egg Supremacy</h1>
        
        <p>Listen up, breakfast warriors. We need to talk about scrambled eggs – the unsung heroes of the morning meal, the golden gods of the frying pan, the fluffy champions that have been saving our souls since approximately 6 AM began existing.</p>
        
         <p>  I'm not saying scrambled eggs are better than winning the lottery, but have you ever tried to eat a lottery ticket? Exactly. Scrambled eggs win by default.</p>
    
        
        <p>These magnificent blobs of protein perfection take less time to make than it takes to argue with your alarm clock. We're talking 5 minutes max – which is basically the culinary equivalent of teleportation. You could literally scramble eggs in the time it takes most people to decide what socks to wear.</p>
           
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <h3>What You Actually Need (Serves 1-2 Normal Humans):</h3>
               <li><strong>6-8 eggs</strong> - Fresh ones work best, but we're not judging your grocery shopping timeline</li>
                <li><strong>2-3 tablespoons butter</strong> - Because life's too short for margarine lies</li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong> - A pinch, unless you're feeling rebellious</li>
                <li><strong>Black pepper</strong> - Freshly cracked if you're fancy, pre-ground if you're honest</li>
                <li><strong>2-3 tablespoons milk or cream</strong> - Optional, but recommended for maximum fluffiness</li>


    <h2>HOW TO DO IT step by step</h2>
    <ol>
         <h3>The Sacred Ritual (Total Time: 5 Minutes of Glory):</h3>
           <li>Step:</li> Crack those eggs into a bowl like you mean it. If you get shell pieces, fish them out – nobody needs that kind of drama in their breakfast. Add milk/cream, salt, and pepper. Whisk until everything's best friends.
                    
                <li>Step:</li> Heat your pan over medium-low heat. Yes, medium-low. I know you want to crank it to high because you're hungry, but patience, grasshopper. Add butter and let it melt into golden glory.
            
                <li>Step:</li> Pour in your egg mixture. Now comes the hard part - do absolutely nothing for about 30 seconds. Resist the urge to poke, prod, or helicopter parent your eggs.
            
                <li>Step:</li> Gently push the cooked edges toward the center with a spatula, tilting the pan to let uncooked egg flow underneath. Repeat this dance of culinary excellence every 30 seconds or so.
           
                <li>Step:</li> When the eggs look almost set but still slightly wet (they'll finish cooking from residual heat), remove from heat. This is called "carryover cooking" – use this term to sound sophisticated at brunch.
            
                <li>Step:</li> Plate immediately and consume while questioning why you ever thought instant oatmeal was acceptable. Congratulations, you've achieved breakfast enlightenment.
            
                <li>Pro Tip:</li> If someone asks for your secret, just smile mysteriously and say "low and slow." They'll think you're a culinary genius, and technically, you're not wrong.
